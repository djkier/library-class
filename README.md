## Features

-   **Add a Book**: Enter details about a book, including the title and author.
-   **Change Book Status**: Update the status of a book to indicate whether it has been read or not.
-   **Delete a Book**: Remove a book from the collection.
-   **Reset Library**: Clear all entries and start fresh.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript. It does not include any data persistence features, so the books entered will not be saved when the page is refreshed.

## Technologies Used

-   **JavaScript**: Core functionality with a focus on prototypal inheritance.
-   **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling of the app.
-   **Figma**: Used for designing the layout and user interface of the app.

## Learning Focus

This project serves as a learning tool for those interested in understanding how prototypal inheritance works in JavaScript. The app does not include advanced features such as data storage, focusing instead on object creation, inheritance, and basic UI interaction.
